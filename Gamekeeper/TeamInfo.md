## Project Summary
Our project is a solution to gamer's dilemma of choosing a game when they are bored or when they want to explore new games. We will be creating a website called GameKeeper that would recommend games based on user inputs such as age, computer, genres, prices, and also data we have such as reviews. We are considering multiple features including:
* A leaderboard that gives you the most popular/highest rated games.
* A search feature that finds you games based on specifications.
* Access to records so that you can manipulate the database.
* A small choice game that helps recommend you a new game based on your preferences between other games.
* A shopping cart maker that, based on specifications and budget, will give you potential lists of games.
* A game comparison tool that can take two games and compare them side to side.
