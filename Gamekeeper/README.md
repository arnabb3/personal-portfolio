## Project Summary
Our project is a solution to gamer's dilemma of choosing a game when they are bored or when they want to explore new games. We will be creating a website called GameKeeper that would recommend games based on user inputs such as age, computer, genres, prices, and also data we have such as reviews. We have multiple features including:
* A leaderboard that gives you the most popular/highest rated games.
* A search feature that finds you games based on specifications.
* Access to records so that you can manipulate the database.
